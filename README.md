# JUCE-Projects
JUCE is an open source framework commonly used to make audio plug-ins & applications. I have a passion for both 
programming & music so this respo will be for the plug-ins I learned to build with JUCE. I'm focusing on VST3 plugins 
as I've used various VST plugins for years when working on music. The easiest way to test these plugins would be to find 
the VST3 file in VST3 folder within the debug folder, copy the VST3 folder into your computer's local VST3 plugin folder 
& add the plugin whatever DAW you use like Reaper, Ableton, FL Studio etc.
